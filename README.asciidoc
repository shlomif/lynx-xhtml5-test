Hi Thorsten and everyone,

thanks for your reply.

You claimed that the beta version of lynx has hidden most of the text of the
problematic XHTML 5 pages on shlomifish.org , because their markup was served
with standalone XML tags that didn't have whitespace before the slash in the
"/>".

I set out to test this hypothesis. Based on src.xhtml (originally a copy of
https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/philosophy/putting-cards-on-the-table-2019-2020/
) I generated using generate.py 8 versions with all combinations of whitespace
for "/>" . Turns out lynx-beta erratically hides most of the text on all of them:

https://github.com/shlomif/lynx-xhtml5-test/tree/master/dest-lynx-test

I also wrote a similar script to mutate the markup of the XHTML pages (those ending
with “.html” or “.xhtml” ) on my site under /philosophy/philosophy/
to put a space before the slash in the "/>" . It is currently invoked at every "make test"
stage, and its changes are
present in the live pages under https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/philosophy/
(I checked). the beta version of lynx still does not display most of the text for

~/apps/lynx-beta/bin/lynx https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/philosophy/putting-cards-on-the-table-2019-2020/index.xhtml

( This was done given your request for me to "fix" the pages of my site and given I
do not wish to risk potentially breaking the rest of the site with such a
crudely-implemented change for now. )

Moreover note that as far as I recall, the recommendation to prefix the trailing
slash with space was intended for compatibility with legacy www browsers that had not
been adapted to XML or XHTML. If the page is served as
“Content-Type: application/xml+xhtml” , then a compliant user agent should parse
it as XML. Moreover, most of the pages on my site are validated as XHTML5
using several validators, and firefox and chromium-browser usually handle them well.

(

Stripping the whitespace in question is done by the X/HTML minifier I use, and I might
opt to disable or undo it somehow if it increases compatibility with lynx and other browsers.

Nevertheless https://caniuse.com/xhtml and https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/what-year-is-it and
adding whitespace still doesn't seem to help here.
