Hi Thorsten and everyone,

your claimed that the beta version of lynx has hidden most of the text of the
XHTML 5 pages on shlomifish.org , because their markup was served with
standalone XML tags that didn't have whitespace before the slash in the "/>".

I set out to test this hypothesis. Based on src.xhtml (origly a copy of
https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/philosophy/putting-cards-on-the-table-2019-2020/
) I generated using generate.py 8 versions with all combinations of whitespace
for "/>" and lynx-beta hides most of the text on all of them:

I also wrote a simlar script to mutate the pages on my site under /philosophy/philosophy/
to put a space before the slash in the "/>"
